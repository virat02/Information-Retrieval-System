on normalization requirement divisor divide correct methods this paper presents analysis normalization requirement divisor divide correct method this analysis made subject condition correction required obtain true quotient character trial estimate division precision segment partial remainder suitably rounded single precision divisor this segmented division denoted 2 1 precision basic division it found normalization requirement narrowed smaller range divisors provided magnitude character leading character divisor known if normalization eliminated choose proper higher precision segments operands basic division also considered possibility eliminating normalization increase number corrections quotient estimate 2 1 precision basic division it shown scheme economical small radices cacm december 1967 krishnamurthy e v nandi s k ca671210 jb february 26 1978 2:15 pm
