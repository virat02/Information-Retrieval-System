an algorithm generating permutations an algorithm repeated application generates permutations k elements only previously generated permutation constant k temporary index needed starting ordering k elements abcd repeated application algorithm generate k-1 additional permutations k-1 successive rotations from initial circular ordering k objects circular ordering obtained rotating k-1 lowest elements for k-1 circular ordering k-2 obtained rotating k-2 lowest elements by continuing manner applications algorithm generate k-1 circular orderings circular ordering yields k permutations algorithm generates k permutations cacm may 1967 langdon jr g g ca670508 jb february 28 197810:35 am
