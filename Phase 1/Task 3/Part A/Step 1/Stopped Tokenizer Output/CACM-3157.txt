proving termination multiset orderings a common tool proving termination programs founded set set ordered admit infinite descending sequences the basic approach find termination function maps values program variables founded set termination function repeatedly reduced computation all termination functions required difficult find complexity proportion program consideration multisets bags founded set s sets admit multiple occurrences elements s the ordering s induces ordering finite multisets s this multiset ordering shown founded the multiset ordering enables simple intuitive termination functions difficult termination proofs in multiset ordering prove termination production systems programs defined terms sets rewriting rules cacm august 1979 dershowitz n manna z program correctness program termination program verification founded orderings founded sets multisets bags production systems term rewriting systems tree replacement systems reduction rules 5.24 5.7 ca790803 db january 4 1980 3:44 pm
