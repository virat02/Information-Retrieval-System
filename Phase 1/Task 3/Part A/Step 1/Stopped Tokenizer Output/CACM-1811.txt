a case study programming parallel processors an affirmative partial answer provided question program parallel processor computing systems efficiently decrease execution time problems parallel processor systems multiprocessor systems processors simultaneously execute separate tasks single job cooperating decrease solution time computational problem the processors independent instruction counters meaning processor executes task program independently processors communication cooperating processors means data storage shared processors a program determination distribution electrical network written parallel processor computing system execution program simulated the data gathered simulation runs demonstrate efficient solution problem typical large class important problems it shown proper programming solution time n processors applied approaches 1 n times solution time single processor improper programming actually lead increase solution time number processors stability method solution investigated cacm december 1969 rosenfeld j l parallel processor parallelism parallel programming multiprocessor multiprogramming tasking storage interference electrical network simulation relaxation jacobi gauss seidel convergence 3.24 4.9 5.14 5.17 6.21 ca691201 jb february 15 1978 4:45 pm
