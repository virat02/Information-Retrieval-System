copying list structures using bounded workspace two algorithms presented list structure copying bounded workspace the primarily theoretical interest shows cell tag bits task performed time 2 the algorithm assuming tag bit cell delivers attractive practical speed any noncyclic structure copied linear speed cyclic structures copied average time nlogn no foreknowledge cycle absence achieve linear speed a variation algorithm solves open problem concerning list structure marking that result demonstrates marking average time nlogn aid supplemental tag bits stacks cacm april 1974 lindstrom g list processing copying marking space complexity 4.34 5.25 ca740405 jb january 18 1978 9:55 am
