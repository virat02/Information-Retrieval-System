pert time calculations without topological ordering a simplified technique presented pert time calculations topological ordering each event assigned unique memory location an activity represented link a link defined memory location address memory location the time information activity carried link for typical net majority activities 36 bit cell the remainder 36 bit cells the links unidirectional forward t e calculation expected completion time activity backward t l calculation time latest allowable completion activity the calculations progress net topologically net represented topologically core cacm march 1965 lass s e ca650312 jb march 7 1978 6:00 pm
