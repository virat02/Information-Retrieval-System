extending information theory approach converting limited entry decision tables computer programs this paper modifies earlier algorithm converting decision tables flowcharts minimize subsequent execution time compiled computer program the algorithms considered paper perform limited search necessarily result globally optimal solutions however greater search effort needed obtain globally optimal solution complex decision tables justified sufficient savings execution time there analogy problem converting decision tables efficient flowcharts understood problem information theory noiseless coding the results noiseless coding literature explore limitations algorithms solve decision table problem the analogy problems develop improvements information algorithm extending depth search conditions proposing additional conditions added decision table finally information algorithm compared algorithm proposed recent paper verhelst cacm september 1974 shwayder k coding decision tables flowcharting information theory noiseless channel sorting 3.50 5.31 ca740910 jb january 17 1978 8:40 am
