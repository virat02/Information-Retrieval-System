a fast method solving class tridiagonal linear systems the solution linear systems real symmetric diagonally dominant tridiagonal coefficient matrices constant diagonals considered it proved diagonals lu decomposition converges floating point precision it proved computed lu decomposition converges floating point arithmetic limits lu diagonals floating point roughly machine precision limits real arithmetic this fact exploited reduce number floating point operations required solve linear system 8n-7 5n 2k-3 order matrix if elements subdiagonals superdiagonals 1 4n 2k-3 operations needed the entire lu decomposition takes words storage considerable savings array subscripting achieved upper lower bounds obtained terms ratio coefficient matrix diagonal constants parameters floating point number system various generalizations results discussed cacm january 1974 malcolm m a palmer j numerical linear algebra linear systems toeplitz matrices tridiagonal matrices 5 5.1 5.11 5.14 5.17 ca740102 jb january 18 1978 2:50 pm
